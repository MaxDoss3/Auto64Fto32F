Version 1.4

- Added //CUSTOM keyword at the start of line
  * Can be used ot specify keywords which should be ignored
  * E.g. //CUSTOM ignore FOobar64

Version 1.3

- All tokens that contain /**/ are ignored.
  Before ignore statements had to be explicitly added by converting then converting back
- Added //NOFILTER special token. The //NOFILTER is removed and everything after it is inserted as is
  This is to get around IntelliJ auto import removing all special encoding from an import statement
